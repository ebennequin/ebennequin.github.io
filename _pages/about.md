I completed a PhD with [Sicara](https://www.sicara.ai/) and CentraleSup√©lec on Few-Shot Image Classification, 
with a special interest in bridging the gap between the classical formulation of the few-shot problem and 
real life use cases.
Check out the video of my [Ph.D. defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TC3AyeStBXs)(in French) from Sep. 19, 2023.

I love sharing my work in any way I can. On this site you will find [all my publications](https://ebennequin.github.io/publications/),
