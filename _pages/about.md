I am a Ph.D candidate with [Sicara](https://www.sicara.ai/) and CentraleSupélec. 
I am working on Few-Shot Image Classification, with a special interest in bridging the gap between
the classical formulation of the few-shot problem and real life use cases.

I love sharing my work in any way I can. On this site you will find all my publications, 
along with blog posts, videos, and open-source contributions.

My thesis is expertly and kindly supervised by Céline Hudelot and Myriam Tami (MICS, CentraleSupélec),
and Antoine Toubhans (Sicara).

This site is still a work in progress.
