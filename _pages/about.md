I am a Ph.D candidate with [Sicara](https://www.sicara.ai/) and CentraleSupélec. 
I am working on Few-Shot Image Classification, with a special interest in bridging the gap between
the classical formulation of the few-shot problem and real life use cases.

My thesis is expertly and kindly supervised by Céline Hudelot and Myriam Tami (MICS, CentraleSupélec),
and Antoine Toubhans (Sicara).

I love sharing my work in any way I can. On this site you will find [all my publications](https://ebennequin.github.io/publications/), 
along with blog posts, [videos](https://ebennequin.github.io/videos/), 
and my contribution to open-source: [EasyFSL](https://ebennequin.github.io/easyfsl/).
