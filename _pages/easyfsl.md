I designed a PyTorch library to help people start their own reproducible experiments on few-shot image classification.

It's called EasyFSL and it's meant to make Few-Shot Learning easy. Go play with it [here](https://github.com/sicara/easy-few-shot-learning)!

You can also just install it with PyPi: `pip install easyfsl` and it's done.

Also find a tutorial based on EasyFSL's code [here](https://www.sicara.ai/blog/your-few-shot-model-15mn-pytorch).
